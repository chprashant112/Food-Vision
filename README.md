# Food-Vision
Food Vision is a deep learning-based project designed to accurately classify different types of food from images. The project leverages transfer learning techniques, using pre-trained models such as EfficientNet and ResNet, to recognize and categorize food across 50 different classes. This system is ideal for dietary tracking, food apps, and restaurant menus, where identifying food items from images can streamline processes and reduce manual errors. With a 90% accuracy rate, Food Vision simplifies food classification tasks, making it easier for users to log their meals or identify food items in real-time applications.
